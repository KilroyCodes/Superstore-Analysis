# Superstore_Data_Analysis
## Overview
For this data analysis, I've taken an imaginary dataset from Kaggle.

This dataset contains information on customer orders from a 'Superstore' which sells items like furniture and technology to customers in the consumer, corporate, and home office segments.

Our target audience for this analysis will be key stakeholders wanting to see KPIs and other pertinent values from the latest year (2017 in this dataset), and any resulting insights.

## Tools used
**Python**:
- Data loading, cleaning, and reorganising
- KPI calculations and tabulation
- Data visualisation (line charts, bar charts, heat maps)

**Google slides:**
- Mock presentation of analysis, including results, insights, and recommendations
